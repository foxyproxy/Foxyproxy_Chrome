Proxy servers are specialized Internet servers built to relay IP traffic from one set of addresses to another, in order to make traffic from one address look like it is coming from another.

Proxy servers enable travelers to access their favorite video/audio sites (BBC iplayer, Hulu, ITV, Pandora, NetFlix, NFL) from most any location in the world should they be traveling through regions where traffic from the broadcaster is being blocked. Sales and Marketing groups use them to perform GeoIP tests, in order to be certain that advertising & local content is reaching the intended markets. They can bypass content-filtering from nations & institutions censoring the web for your "protection".

When a person has located a proxy server in the region they need to relay through, their job is to then configure their computer to relay through that proxy server, which can be complicated.  

FoxyProxy minimizes the process of configuring your computer to talk through a proxy server, with a reduced set of simplified, browser-based controls.  

FoxyProxy Basic is a lean and fast proxy on/off switcher for people who don't need extra bells & whistles. This saves time for those tech-savvy enough to configure their computer to talk to a proxy-server, but are too busy, and it stops headaches for those choosing to focus their talents on goals other than the deep workings of technology, yet still must use technology.
