Proxy servers are specialized internet servers built to relay IP traffic from one sub-net of IP addresses to another, in order to make traffic from one sub-net look like it is coming from another.

This is useful for several reasons:

Sales and Marketing groups use them to perform GeoIP tests, in order to be certain that advertising & local content is reaching the intended markets. 

It enables travelers to access their favorite video/audio sites (BBC iplayer, Hulu, ITV, Pandora, NetFlix, NFL) from most any location in the world should they be traveling through regions where traffic from the broadcaster is being blocked.

It can bypass content-filtering from nations & institutions censoring the web for your "protection".

For needs like these, a wide assortment of proxy servers were set up around the globe.
  
Some proxy servers are commercial grade - they must work - while others are free, running on luck.

When a person has located a proxy server in the region they need to relay through, their job is to then configure their computer to relay through that proxy server, which can be complicated.  

Sometimes one must dig deep into the configuration of the browser, sometimes deep into the network configuration of the operating system, and sometimes both, which is where FoxyProxy steps in.

FoxyProxy minimizes the process of configuring your computer to talk through a proxy server, with a reduced set of simplified, browser-based controls.  

This saves time for those tech-savvy enough to configure their computer to talk to a proxy-server, but are too busy, and it stops headaches for those choosing to focus their talents on goals other than the deep workings of technology, yet still must use technology.

Try It.
