How to build FoxyProxy for Chrome with Grunt.

1. Read the Chrome extension packaging guide:
    http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging.html

2. Install NodeJS and NPM (the Node Package Manager):
    http://nodejs.org/
    
3. Find a command-line, and run:
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    
4. In this directory (the top-level of foxyproxy-chrome source, where you found this file), run:
    npm install
    
5. To build the Standard edition for Chrome (which is the default), run:
    grunt build
    
    The packaged files are copied to ./dist/ and a zip file suitable for uploading will be output in ./package/
    
6. To build a different edition, use --target and --edition command-line options, e.g.
    grunt build --target=Chrome --edition=Basic
    
7. The 'release' target will run the 'build' target, and then attempt to create a signed .crx file in the package/ directory.

    This assumes that you have the correct keyfile in the project's parent directory, or you can specify the path with the --keyfile argument.
    
    The --ga_key parameter should contain the account identifier for the FoxyProxy for Chrome app in the Google Analytics account.
